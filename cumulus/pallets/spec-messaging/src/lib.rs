//! # Speculative Messaging pallet (sender half)
//!
//! Accumulates a parachain's OUTBOUND Speculative Messaging streams and commits to them with a
//! single [`StreamsRoot`] per block, emitted as the `Provides` UMP signal (via
//! [`ProvideUmpSignals`]) and deposited as an [`SPMS_ENGINE_ID`] digest.
//!
//! Each stream is an append-only MMR; its frontier ([`MmrFrontier`]) is the only long-lived state.
//! The [`StreamsRoot`] is the root of the stream commitment tree over `{stream -> stream root}`; it
//! is recomputed from the frontiers at the end-of-block fold via the canonical
//! [`streams_root`](cumulus_primitives_spec_messaging::streams_root::streams_root), so the pallet
//! never stores a tree — the frontiers determine it.
//!
//! ## Block lifecycle
//!
//! - Messages of block `N` are appended to [`OutboundMessages`] (per-stream, this-block only) via
//!   [`Pallet::append_to_stream`]. The stored frontier is untouched during the block, so a message
//!   position is stable from the moment of the send.
//! - `on_finalize` of block `N` folds this block's sends into a transient root and memoizes it in
//!   [`BlockStreamsRoot`] ([`Pallet::commit_streams_root`]); idle blocks touch nothing and emit
//!   nothing.
//! - `on_initialize` of block `N+1` drains [`OutboundMessages`] into the persistent
//!   [`OutboundFrontier`] and clears the previous block's memo — one atomic step.
//!
//! Messages must be appended before this pallet's `on_finalize` runs; a payload appended by a later
//! `on_finalize` hook would miss the fold (the "append before `on_finalize`" ordering rule, which
//! covers parachain-system's `on_finalize` too).
//!
//! This is the SENDER half only: the receiver (messaging inherent, consumption record), the channel
//! lifecycle, and the XCM router land in later PRs. [`Pallet::consumption_record`] therefore
//! returns empty here.
