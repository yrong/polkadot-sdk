//! # Speculative Messaging pallet
//!
//! Sender: accumulates outbound streams (per-stream MMR frontiers) and commits one [`StreamsRoot`]
//! per block, emitted as the `Provides` UMP signal ([`ProvideUmpSignals`]) and an
//! [`SPMS_ENGINE_ID`] digest. Receiver: consumes fetched inbound payloads through
//! [`Call::enact_messages`] by recomputation into [`InboundFrontier`], writing the block's
//! [`ConsumptionRecord`]. The inherent carries no proofs; the PoV lift binds the endpoint.
//!
//! Lifecycle: block `N` stages its sends and consumption; `on_finalize` folds the [`StreamsRoot`];
//! the first spec-msg action of `N+1` ([`Pallet::roll_over`]) drains the sends and clears the rest.
