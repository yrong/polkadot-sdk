//! Speculative Messaging node side: the off-chain half that moves payloads between collators.
//!
//! - [`Archive`]: the own chain's sends, served under the root a requester names.
//! - [`run_archiver`]: keeps the archive current through reorgs and retention.
//! - [`exchange_protocol_config`] and [`run_request_handler`]: the `/spec-msg/exchange/1` protocol.
//! - [`Receiver`]: fetches under each source's newest included root, keeps what verifies, builds
//!   the messaging inherent within a [`Budget`] and assembles each candidate's lifts.
//! - [`run_receiver`], [`inherent_data`] and [`assembler`]: its ties to the chain and collator.
//!
//! Design: paritytech/polkadot-sdk#12659 (v0.5).
