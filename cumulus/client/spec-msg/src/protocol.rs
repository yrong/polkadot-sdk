//! The `/spec-msg/exchange/1` request-response protocol (design § Fetch Protocol).
//!
//! The two ends belong to different chains, so the name is not genesis-scoped: both sides must
//! agree on it a priori. Nothing is trusted by connection: every request names the `StreamsRoot`
//! it is willing to depend on, and the requester verifies the response against exactly that root
//! (`cumulus_primitives_spec_messaging::verify_exchange`).
//!
//! A server that cannot serve refuses at the transport level, with no detail: a request is a pure
//! function of `(stream, position, under)`; it either serves or fails.
