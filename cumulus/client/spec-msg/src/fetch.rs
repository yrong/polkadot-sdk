//! The requester side of `/spec-msg/exchange/1` (design § Fetch Protocol, § Verification).
//!
//! A request goes to the source's peers in turn. The first response that verifies under the root
//! the request names is accepted; nothing about the peer is trusted. A refusal or a response that
//! does not verify only moves on to the next peer. Some refusals are expected, for example a
//! channel accepted before the sender opened it (§ Fetch Protocol, pre-authorization), so no peer
